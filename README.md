# Sentiment Analysis of Text using Naive Bayes
Explore sentiment analysis using Naive Bayes algorithm on a dataset of positive and negative reviews. This project demonstrates hands-on implementation from scratch and compares results with a Python library. Developed in Python on Google Colab.


## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive exploration of sentiment analysis on text using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The project focuses on classifying reviews into positive and negative sentiments and comprises two key components:

### 1. Implementation of Naive Bayes Algorithm from Scratch
   - In-depth understanding and manual implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm.
   - Application to a dataset of 1000 positive and 1000 negative processed reviews.

### 2. Application of Naive Bayes using Python Library
   - Utilization of Python libraries for Naive Bayes to compare performance.
   - Integration with Google Colab for an efficient and collaborative development environment.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the polarity dataset v2.0, consisting of meticulously processed reviews, including 1000 positive and 1000 negative instances.

**Dataset Source:** [Pang/Lee ACL 2004](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/)

## How to Run

1. **Download Dataset:** Fetch the dataset from the provided link.
2. **Open Notebook:** Utilize Google Colab or any Python environment to open the notebook.
3. **Execute Code:** Run the cells to load data, implement Naive Bayes, and perform sentiment analysis.

## Implementation Highlights

- **From Scratch:**
  - Hands-on implementation of Naive Bayes algorithm.
  - Detailed code explanations for transparency and learning.

- **Using Python Library:**
  - Integration with established Python libraries.
